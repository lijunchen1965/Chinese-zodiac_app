Chinese Zodia Application

The Chinese lunar calendar, also known as the 农历 (Nónglì), is a lunisolar calendar, meaning it incorporates elements of both the moon's phases and the solar year. 
Each month begins with a new moon, and months usually have either 29 or 30 days. The Chinese New Year, or Lunar New Year, starts on the first day of the first lunar 
month (正月, Zhēngyuè) and shifts each year based on the lunar calendar. It usually falls between January 21 and February 20.

Each Chinese Year is associated with one of the 12 animals composing the zodiac cycle, which include Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, 
Rooster, Dog, Pig in that order. Each zodiac cycle includes 12 years, starting with Rat, and ends with Pig. Then the next zodiac cycle of 12 years begin again with Rat.
According to Chinese tradition, people born in different years of the zodiac cycle are associated with specific personality traits. Peole born in different years may be 
more or less compatible with each other.
